# This example creates a polygonal model of a Cone e visualize the results in a
# VTK render window.
# The program creates the cone, rotates it 360ยบ and closes
# The pipeline  source -> mapper -> actor -> renderer  is typical 
# and can be found in most VTK programs

# Import all VTK modules

    # (output type is vtkPolyData) which other filters may process.

    # of the mapper's graphics primitives. An actor also refers to properties
    # via a vtkProperty instance, and includes an internal transformation
    # matrix. We set this actor's mapper to be coneMapper which we created
    # above.
